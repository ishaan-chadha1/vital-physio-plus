  },            Swimming, while being a low-impact sport, puts the shoulder complex under repetitive stress. Without the right approach, even elite swimmers are at risk of “swimmer’s shoulder”—pain and dysfunction that can sideline your performance. At VitalPhysio⁺, we specialize in sports rehab to keep shoulders resilient, injury-free, and strong in and out of the pool.

            <strong>Bonus Tip:</strong> Always warm up shoulders with dynamic movements (e.g., arm circles, band pull-aparts) and prioritize cool-down stretches after every swim session.
