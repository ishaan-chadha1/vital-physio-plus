            The Physiotherapy Perspective: Prevention vs. Treatment
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            From a physiotherapy standpoint, investing in proper ergonomics is far more cost-effective than treating chronic pain conditions. Poor workplace setup contributes to 60% of work-related musculoskeletal disorders in India's IT sector. A well-designed ergonomic chair, combined with proper education, can prevent years of chronic pain and disability.
