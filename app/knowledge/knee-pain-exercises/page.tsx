            The Importance of Post-Surgical Rehabilitation at VitalPhysio⁺: Empowering Recovery with Water Treadmill Therapy and Advanced Modalities
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Recovering after surgery—especially joint surgeries like knee replacement—is about far more than wound healing. At VitalPhysio⁺ in Bengaluru, post-surgical rehabilitation is the foundation for restoring full mobility, preventing complications, and regaining independence. Our clinic combines the latest evidence-based physiotherapy with cutting-edge modalities such as the water treadmill to provide a comprehensive, individualized recovery pathway.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">
            Why Is Post-Surgical Rehabilitation So Critical?
          </h2>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            <li>
              <strong>Accelerated Healing:</strong> Guided rehabilitation reduces pain, builds strength, and speeds up healing, helping you return to daily activities and an active lifestyle faster.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Prevention of Complications:</strong> Regular physiotherapy prevents serious issues such as joint stiffness, scar tissue formation, muscle atrophy, and loss of mobility. Without rehabilitation, the risk of chronic pain, compensatory injuries, and slow functional recovery increases dramatically.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Restoration of Mobility and Confidence:</strong> Targeted exercises restore muscle power and joint motion while reducing swelling. Rehabilitation also supports mental well-being by empowering patients with knowledge and progress tracking.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Education for Life:</strong> Our therapists guide you through proper movement strategies and coordinate a safe transition from clinic-based therapy to independent exercise routines at home.
            </li>
          </ul>

            How the Water Treadmill Enhances Your Recovery
          </h2>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
            <li>
              <strong>Low-Impact, High-Gain:</strong> Water’s natural buoyancy reduces load on healing joints, making walking and exercise safe even soon after surgery. It also decreases the risk of falls and further injury.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Enhanced Muscle Strength and Mobility:</strong> Resistance from water helps rebuild muscle without weights, while the supportive environment allows gentle restoration of movement, even for those with pain or stiffness.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Reduced Pain and Swelling:</strong> Aquatic exercise promotes blood flow, reduces inflammation, and soothes post-surgical pain with the warmth and pressure of water.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Faster Functional Recovery:</strong> Because water treadmill therapy poses fewer risks than land-based exercise, patients can start sooner, regain mobility quickly, and confidently progress through harder tasks as strength returns.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Enjoyable Therapy Experience:</strong> Many patients report that aquatic therapy lifts their spirits, improves motivation, and fosters a positive mindset throughout recovery.
